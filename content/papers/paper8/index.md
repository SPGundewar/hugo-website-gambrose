## Abstract

A collaboration's ability to convene diverse stakeholders and knowledge is often associated with success. However, a more nuanced evaluation of representation is needed to understand if meeting-level factors (e.g., who attends as well as including facilitators or external technical experts) influence representation. This article examines representation via two-way communication in meetings to explore: (1) patterns of discussion across sectors (i.e., appointed citizens, agency delegates, and external stakeholders), (2) how patterns of discussion change given attendance differences across sectors, and (3) how meeting-level factors associate with observed discussion patterns. Using meeting-level data, across three US, state-level, legislatively-mandated environmental justice councils, results suggest: (1) sectors have different patterns of how much and with whom they discuss, (2) retreat meetings increase discussion for all, and (3) other meeting-level factors and discussion patterns are narrowly focused to specific sectors. The discussion applies the findings of this study to the broader field of collaborative governance.
