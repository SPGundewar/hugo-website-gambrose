## Abstract

Representation, conflict among stakeholders, and how both shape outputs are of growing interest in collaborative governance
research. As individuals negotiate diverse viewpoints, conflict is expected, yet gaps remain in understanding if conflict, or lack thereof, helps explain output prioritization. In this paper, we explore: (i) if more communication is associated with topics succeeding or failing to be prioritized; (ii) if communication from different types of actors (i.e., different sector affiliations/core or peripheral members) is associated with prioritization; (iii) how conflict and concord embedded in communication associate with prioritization; and (iv) whether patterns of prioritization can be identified. Using Hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation modeling and multi-group QAP models, we evaluate associations between topical issues discussed and annual objectives, finding: (i) communication quantity is necessary but insufficient in prioritization; (ii) who communicates is vital to prioritization; and (iii) conflict is only detrimental when its association is greater than concord.
