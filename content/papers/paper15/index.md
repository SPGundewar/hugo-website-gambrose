## Abstract

Cities are increasingly interested in better understanding the agricultural resources supporting urban demand for food, both from the perspective of food security and environmental sustainability (water, GHG/energy, land). This has led to increasing interest in quantifying the role of local agriculture to meet urban demand. However, to date, there are few tools available for cities to aggregate disparate local agricultural data across spatial scales to quantify four categories of local production of: 1) household gardens, 2) community gardens, 3) peri-urban direct to consumer commercial farms, 4) peri-urban standard commercial farms.
This paper presents three hybrid methodologies that when combined can provide a robust multi-scale analysis of various types of food production, in and around cities. This allows comparison of the relative yield, land area and the associated distribution of water, energy/GHG impacts of the four distinct types of local agriculture serving urban food demand by: 1) household gardens, 2) community gardens, 3) peri-urban direct to consumer commercial farms, 4) peri-urban standard commercial farms.) The three unique methods and data sources include:
A satellite imagery-augmented field survey with deep learning image identification to identify household gardens combined
City survey data combined with deep learning image identification to identify community gardens
Local agriculture directories and government zoning data to identify local direct to consumer and standard commercial farms.
We apply these methods to the Twin Cities Region (Minneapolis-St. Paul), Minnesota, USA, to illustrate the analysis and to demonstrate the distribution of agriculture areas across categories and potential contribution to local urban provisioning.
