## Inclusive Governance: Handbook Themes and Next Steps
As conveyed at its outset, this Handbook is intentionally designed to offer an expansive survey of inclusive governance. This wide-reaching approach allows us to explore how inclusive governance manifests in different public affairs domains, and the various ways in which researchers and practitioners have engaged with it. At the same time, the Handbook aims to foster clarity in distinguishing properties of inclusive governance to support its differentiation from other governance approaches. It furthermore illuminates aspects of inclusive governance that can serve as the focal subject(s) of research inquiry and practice. In doing so, the Handbook sets a foundation for continued inclusive governance research and also offers key takeaways for application in practice. This concluding chapter draws on lessons learned from previous chapters, and our own survey of the field, to identify common themes and opportunities for advancing inclusive governance in research and practice.
