My research utilizes a **policy process lens** to explore:  
1. Representation in collaborative fora, as well as the influence diverse representation has on collaborative outputs and outcomes; and  
2. The evolution of policy design.  

As such, I have developed a research agenda focused on:  
1. Examining the underlying assumptions of collaborative governance by operationalizing and measuring concepts such as representation, participation, institutional evolution, and interpersonal conflict; and  
2. Using advanced computational and network methods to evaluate patterns of policy evolution as they are rooted in policy process theory.  

This focus is aided by skills in **advanced network analysis**, **computational text mining**, and **natural language processing**.  
In addition to these computational skills, I have also designed and administered **survey** and **interview research projects**, positioning myself as a **competent mixed-methods researcher**.
