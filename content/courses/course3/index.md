## Course Description
Public policy affects most aspects of our lives including, but not limited to, public health, education,
economy, living environment, quality of life, and safety and security. Addressing and understanding
public policy have become increasingly important considering rampant mis- information and mistrust
of evidence. This course is designed to give master’s students in public affairs a background in
understanding critical issues and techniques used in public policy analysis. This course provides
students with core skills and knowledge necessary to understand the causes and consequences of
public policies. Students will conduct a systematic analysis of public policy issues by identifying a range
of policy alternatives to address the policy issues and comparing the alternatives with respect to various
public values including efficiency, feasibility, and social equity and justice. Students will learn using
analytical tools, rationales, and knowledge to make sense of policy interventions and will practice
effective delivery and communication of evidence, data, and policy recommendations at various
levels of government.

This course is also designed to prepare students for their current and future careers in public
service. By the end of the semester, students will be able to develop their ideas about questions such as:

1. What are the proper roles of the government in society? What are theoretical justifications for
public intervention?

2. What are the political dynamics in defining policy problems and choosing policy alternatives? 

3. What are the analytic tools that can be used? 

4. How can we evaluate policy outcomes? 

5. How do you make convincing arguments for communicating your analysis? 

6. What are the limitations of policy analysis?

### Learning objectives
By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Identify and analyze policy issues and problems

- Model and evaluate policy alternatives and tools

- Identify real-world examples of market and government failures

- Recognize difficulties in analyzing policy alternatives and negotiating interest-based resolutions
with stakeholders

- Understand and explain rationales for public policy and government intervention, and
apply the rationales to analyze real-world problems

- Conduct professional policy analyses on social, political, and economic implications of public
policy

- Conduct basic cost-benefit analyses of policies and programs

- Understand and summarize findings from empirical studies examining the impact of public
policies

- Prepare well-organized and understandable policy documents and give clear briefings of the
documents

- Communicate policy analysis with the public based on ethical reasoning and democratic
participation

## Assessments

Students will be asked to apply the concepts from the textbook and lectures to analyze examples. A few rules:

- Students are encouraged to work together to understand course materials and assignment questions. However, students must write their own solutions themselves in their own words.

- You must show how you got the answer. Clearly but briefly show how you derived the answer.

- Answers should be well-organized, understandable, and legible. Make sure your answers are presented in the order of the questions and include question numbers.

- Although I will accept handwritten answers, typed mathematical expressions and computer-generated graphs are preferred. If you have to scan your handwritten answers, please make sure your answers are easy to read.

- One PDF submission per assignment. Do not submit multiple documents for one assignment.

### In-Class Midterm Exam
- This 2-hour in-class midterm exam is intended to make sure students understand the key concepts in public policy analysis.

- This is an open-book test, but you are not allowed to search the internet during the exam.

- The exam will include true-false, matching, short-answer, mathematical derivations, and essay questions.

- You are allowed to use a computer to write and submit your answers electronically on Canvas. Handwritten answers are also fine. Papers will be provided during the exam. Please bring pens and/or pencils for calculation.

### Final Project – Policy Analysis
Students are highly encouraged to work as a group of 2 or 3 to complete the following four parts of the Final Project – Policy Analysis.

- Part 2. **Framing A Policy Problem**: Frame a policy problem as a market or government failure and build a rationale for government action. (up to 1,000 words)

- Part 3. **Presentation**: You will share your policy memo with your classmates (5-7 minutes).  

- Part 4. **Policy memo**: You will prepare a policy memo which includes:
  1. The definition, description, and background of the policy problem, 
  2. Framing of the policy problem, 
  3. At least three policy alternatives, and 
  4. Recommendations and implications. (2,500 - 5,000 words plus references and appendices)
